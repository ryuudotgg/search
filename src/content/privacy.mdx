::::::block{#redirects index="3" text="Third-Party Redirects and 'Bangs'"}

:::::block{#bangs index="3.1" text="About the Bang Feature"}

Our Service provides a feature called "bangs" that allows you to perform searches on third-party websites directly. When you enter a query followed by a special syntax (e.g., "!g" for Google, "!w" for Wikipedia, "!gh" for GitHub), our Service redirects you to the corresponding third-party website with your search query.

**Important:** We do not process, store, or have access to the search queries you enter. Your searches are redirected directly to third-party sites without being logged by our servers.

**Not Affiliated with Search Engines:** Ryuu's Search is an independent service and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to any of the third-party search engines or websites that users can access through our bang feature.
