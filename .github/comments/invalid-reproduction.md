We cannot recreate the issue with the provided information. **Please add a reproduction in order for us to be able to investigate.**

### Why was this issue marked with the `please add a complete reproduction` label?

To be able to investigate, we need access to a reproduction to identify what triggered the issue. We prefer a screen recording of the issue.

### I added a link, why was it still marked?

Ensure the link is pointing to a file that is accessible "[example.com](http://example.com)", "n/a", "will add later", etc. are not acceptable links.

### What happens if I don't provide a sufficient minimal reproduction?

Issues with the `missing reproduction` label that receives no meaningful activity (e.g. new comments with a reproduction link) are automatically closed and locked after **2** days.

If your issue has _not_ been resolved in that time and it has been closed/locked, please open a new issue with the required reproduction.

### I did not open this issue, but it is relevant to me, what can I do to help?

Anyone experiencing the same issue can upvote using the :+1: reaction on the topmost comment (please **do not** comment "I have the same issue" without reproduction steps). Then, we can sort issues by votes to prioritize.
