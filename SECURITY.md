# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, please **do NOT open a public issue**. We encourage responsible disclosure directly to our security team.

We take all legitimate reports seriously and will investigate them promptly. We are committed to working with security researchers to resolve issues quickly.

You can report vulnerabilities by creating an advisory directly in [GitHub](https://github.com/ryuudotgg/create-ryuu-app/security/advisories/new), or by emailing our security team at [security@ryuu.gg](mailto:security@ryuu.gg).
